# 🏗👷🏾 Scaffold-ETH DeFi Challenges

> Welcome to the DeFi-Focused Challenges created by the Scaffold-ETH community. Here you will find challenges that will help you learn how to use 🏗 scaffold-eth-v2 to create decentralized applications on Ethereum (amongst other tools such as Foundry && Hardhat). 🚀

## **🚨 DeFi Sub-Branch Context / Disclaimers**

This repo and all its challenges are part of the DeFi Sub-Branch, where students are invited into writing smart contracts that incorporate actual DeFi protocols. The sub-branch projects are ever-expanding as DeFi is too. The goal of the Defi sub-branch projects/tutorials are to provide students tutorials that foster self-learning in actual DeFi protocols, guide you through some of the basics of integrating with specific protocols, and other useful tips to increase competence to be potentially hireable as an intermediate developer. 

> ❗️ NOTE: **Students taking on this challenge will be expected to embrace self-learning AND it is recommended that they have completed all beginner SRE challenges or show competency elsewhere.** 

The required competency is stated because tying into other protocols is powerful, and with that comes a lot of responsibility when deploying contracts that may end up holding people's actual funds. These tutorials don't do that but they start to show paths for people to build possible fund-holding code. It is key to know what you are doing.

As well, self-learning is required because tying into DeFi protocols and actual professional crypto projects do not guide developers, step-by-step. If you are new to trying to actually plug into a professional project, no worries! We'll touch on some helpful tips as you sort out what the 'norm' is when going through this process. These tips will be specific to each protocol that we are integrating into and learning about.

## 🚩 Challenge 0: 🐇 Uniswap V2 And V3 Liqidity Pool

🧪🦍 Ceate a super simple strategy to get used to the ins and outs of the `harvest` tx flow and the codebase affiliated with writing strategies with Yearn v2 vaults using Foundry. You'll use Foundry to run local tests and local mainnet fork tests against your `strategy.sol` code. 

☑️ Future work: you'll deploy your strategy on testnet, and use Foundry && Scaffold-ETH v2 to generate a front-end for it that anyone can interact with.

## 🚩 (🚨 Release date TBD) - Challenge 2: 🏋🏻♂️ Yearn Strategy #2 - Getting More Reps in with Mellow Protocol && Gearbox Protocol

🏄‍⚙️ Gaining experience in DeFi is like anything, you need more repitions (reps)! Continuing from Challenge 1 here, students will walk through the intricacies of building a more recent DeFi strategy atop of Mellow Protocol && Gearbox Protocol. This strategy was led by one of our BUIDLERs umphams (@steve0xp).

☑️ Future work: you'll deploy your strategy on testnet, and use Foundry && Scaffold-ETH v2 to generate a front-end for it that anyone can interact with.
